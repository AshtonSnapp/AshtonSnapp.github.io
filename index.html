            <p>Well hello there! This is my website, a personal project and a hub for <em>other</em> personal projects.</p>
            <p>I'll list off all the sub-sites under this line. Have an awesome day!</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Jitcaep Sep [ Worldbuilding information for my nation on NationStates ]</li>

            <p>If you want more information on me, I'm a freshman at Louisiana Tech University majoring in Computer Science. Reason? Video games. That's what I want to do.<br>Who knows, I might upload school projects on here as well (assuming I get permission from the professor).</p>
